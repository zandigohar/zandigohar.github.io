## # about {#about .code}

**PhD candidate in Bioinformatics (UIC, 2020 – 2025)**  
Focused on generative AI for single-cell & spatial genomics.  
I build *interpretable* VAEs, transformers, and retrieval-augmented pipelines to map transcription-factor networks and cell-cell communication.

## # experience {#experience .code}

- **Graduate Research Assistant – U Illinois Chicago** (2023 – 2025)  
  Developed **scRegulate**, a TF-aware VAE that outperforms leading tools by **10 – 50 %** on AUROC/AUPRC and remains robust under 30 % dropout noise.  

- **Research Assistant – UIC** (2021 – 2023)  
  Benchmarked latent-inference models for sparse scATAC-seq; first-author paper at *IEEE BIBM 2022*.  

- **Lab Computing Lead – UIC** (2022 – present)  
  Maintained three multi-user GPU servers, secured an NVIDIA GPU grant, and mentored 10 + researchers on CUDA workflows.

## # projects {#projects .code}

- **scRegulate** – interpretable VAE for TF activity; open-source with CI/CD, PyPI & Conda packages.  

- **RAGulate** – retrieval-augmented LLM framework validating TF–gene links with PubMed evidence (in progress).  

- **Single-cell Atlas of Uterine Fibroids** – mapped 16 cell types and novel fibroblast subtypes (*Human Reproduction 2022*).
